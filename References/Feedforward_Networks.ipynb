        "As described in Wikipedia TensorFlow is a computational framework for building machine learning models. It is the second generation system from Google Brain headed by Jeff Dean. Launched in early 2017, it has disrupted the ML world by bringing in numerous capabilities from scalability to building production ready models.\n",
        "\n",
        "TensorFlow (TF) is an open source software library for numerical computation using the concept of Tensors. You can think of Tensors as being a generalisation of matrices to higher dimensions, or roughly equivalent to multi-dimensional arrays. Scalars are 0-dimensional tensors, vectors are 1-dimensional, standard matrices are 2-dimensional, and higher-dimensional tensors have 3 or more dimensions. You can think of dimensions as representing groups of numbers that mean the same thing. For example, for images, we often use 3-dimensional tensors where the first dimension represents the red, green, and blue color channels of the image, and the next two are the columns and rows of pixels of the image. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: Don't be confused when people say \"2-D vector\" or \"3-D vector\", which refers to a 1-dimensional tensor that has size 2 or 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "The major advantage of using TensorFlow is that it can automatically derive the gradients of many mathematical expressions involving tensors. It achieves this through a process called \"automatic differentiation\". Tensorflow also supports multiple \"kernels\", allowing you to easily run your code on normal processors (CPUs), graphics cards (GPUs) and other more exotic hardware accelerators like Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)\n",
        "\n",
        "Tensorflow actually provides **two modes of operation**, the first, called \"graph mode\", builds a computation graph upfront and then feeds data into the graph. By building the graph upfront, Tensorflow can apply optimisations to the graph that allow it to extract peak performance from the hardware you're running on. You will have encountered this mode if you used Tensorflow before or attended the Indaba last year! The second mode, called [\"Eager-mode\"](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager), is a lot newer and evaluates Tensor operations imperatively (in the order you write them), similar to NumPy and PyTorch. Eager-mode is slightly less performant but a lot more intuitive, especially if you've never used a \"define-and-run\" programming style (like graph mode) before, and is therefore the mode we will use in these practicals.

        "As we did in the previous practical, we need to specify a loss function for our classifier. This tells us how good our model's predictions are compared to the actual labels (the targets), with a lower loss meaning better predictions. The standard loss function to use with a **multi-class classifier** is the **cross-entropy loss** also known as the \"negative log likelihood\" for a classifier. Suppose we have a classification problem with $C$ classes. A classifier is trained to predict a probability distribution $p(y | X_i)$ for each input $X_i$ from a batch of $N$ examples. The vector $p(y|X_i)$ is $C$ dimensional, sums to one, and we use $p(y|X_i)_c$ to denote the $c$th component of  $p(y|X_i)$. The true class for example $i$ in the batch is $y_i$ and we define the indicator function $\\mathbb{1}[y_i=c]$ to be 1 whenever $y_i = c$ and $0$ otherwise. This classifier has a cross-entropy loss of\n",

        "**NOTE**: The indicator is one for the true class label, and zero everywhere else. So in that sum, the indicator just \"lifts out\" the $log(p(y|X_i))$ values for all true classes. So the above expression is minimised (note the negative at the front) when the model places all its probability mass on the true labels for all the examples. Remember that  log(1)=0 , thus the closer all probabilities of $y_i = c$ are to one, the lower the loss will be and the better the model will be performing.\n",

        "In addition to the problem of _overfitting_ (in which the model is too complex and as a result is able to memorize the training data rather than learning a general pattern) there is the problem of _underfitting_ which is the opposite. Underfitting occurs when the model does not have enough complexity (also known as capacity) to learn a general pattern. While overfitting is characterised by diverging test/validation and training scores, underfitting is characterised by test/validation and training scores that very slowly continue to improve. \n",

        "Unlike overfitting which has a number of solutions, such as collecting more data, data augmentation, dropout, and L1/L2 regularization, underfitting has one simple solution: just make your model incrementally more complex until it no longer underfits.\n",
